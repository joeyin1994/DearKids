"Dear Ella," hooted Wise Owl, "to enjoy the tastiest fruits, you must wash your hands with the sparkling water from the Crystal River before eating."

Excited, Ella scampered to the Crystal River, its water gleaming like diamonds. She dipped her trunk and washed her big, floppy ears and wiggled her toes. Suddenly, a magical glow surrounded her. The fruits sparkled with extra sweetness as Ella munched on them.

From that day on, all the animals in Cleanopia followed Ella's example. The land bloomed with health and happiness as everyone washed their hands before enjoying their meals. Ella's kindness had turned Cleanopia into a place where every meal was a magical feast!

And so, with clean paws and happy hearts, the animals of Cleanopia lived joyfully ever after. The end.
